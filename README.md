## Java Solutions

### Shuffle an Array
- **Description**: Implemented a custom method to shuffle an array of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` without using built-in methods like `Collections.shuffle()`.
  
- **Implementation**: The `shuffleArray()` method uses a random swap algorithm to shuffle the array.

---

### Convert Roman Numerals to Integer
- **Description**: Created a function that converts Roman numeral strings (e.g., `IX`) into their corresponding integer values (e.g., `9`).
  
- **Implementation**: The conversion is done using a dictionary of Roman numeral values and iterating over the string.

---

### Pangram Checker
- **Description**: A function that checks if a sentence is a **pangram** (contains all the letters of the alphabet at least once).
  
- **Implementation**: The string is converted to lowercase and checked using a set to ensure all letters are present.

---

## JavaScript Solutions

### Reverse Words in a Sentence
- **Description**: A function that reverses each word in a sentence without changing the word order.
  
- **Implementation**: The sentence is split into words, and each word is reversed individually.

---

### Sort Array in Descending Order
- **Description**: A custom sorting algorithm to sort an array in descending order without relying on JavaScript's built-in `sort()` method.
  
- **Implementation**: A simple sorting algorithm, like bubble sort, is used to sort the array in descending order.

---

## HTML Projects

### Basic Calculator
- **Description**: A simple **Basic Calculator** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  
- **Live Demo**: [Basic Calculator](https://parthasarathy27.github.io/Coding-Assignment---ASE/Html_assignment/basic%20calculator/index.html)

---

### Survey Form
- **Description**: A **Survey Form** that collects user information such as Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Profession, Email, and Mobile Number. It includes form validation to ensure all fields are completed before submission.
  
- **Live Demo**: [Survey Form](https://parthasarathy27.github.io/Coding-Assignment---ASE/Html_assignment/survey%20form/index.html)

## How to Run the Code

### Java:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the Java files (`ShuffleArray.java`, `RomanToInteger.java`, `PangramChecker.java`).
3. Compile and run the Java files in your IDE or terminal.

### JavaScript (Node.js):
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure **Node.js** is installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the JavaScript files (`reverseWords.js`, `sortArray.js`).
4. Run the JavaScript files using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node reverseWords.js
   node sortArray.js
   ```

### HTML:
1. Open `basicCalculator.html` or `surveyForm.html` in any modern web browser to interact with the projects.
2. Both projects are functional with embedded JavaScript for interactivity.
